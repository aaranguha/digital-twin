## Professional Experience

**Data Scientist** — *N2IA Technologies, Washington, DC*  
*October 2024 – Present*  
- Built and deployed Random Forest regression models in Palantir Vantage to forecast service requirements (bedspaces, staffing, facilities) across U.S. Army installations using site population and operational metadata. (Python, pandas, scikit-learn)  
- Designed ETL pipelines to clean and one-hot encode categorical DoD data; automated data extraction and transformation using Power Automate integrated with Microsoft Dataverse.  
- Achieved high predictive performance through feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning, reaching **96.11% R²** for average billeting issue and **93.13% R²** for bedspace forecasts.  
- Certified in **PL-900: Microsoft Power Platform Fundamentals** (Power BI, Power Apps, Dataverse).  
- Security Clearance: Active CAC (DoD Common Access Card)

**Machine Learning Intern** — *UXly, Santa Cruz, CA*  
*January 2024 – June 2024*  
- Developed a bot detection model using TensorFlow and Keras with two hidden layers (64 neurons, ReLU) and a sigmoid output layer for binary classification.  
- Computed and applied class weights to handle imbalanced data using binary cross-entropy loss, Adam optimizer, and accuracy metrics.  
- Implemented the model in the website backend using TypeScript, enabling real-time bot detection and improving security and user experience.

**Data Engineering Intern** — *Sephora, San Francisco, CA*  
*June 2023 – August 2023*  
- Used generative AI tools (Midjourney, ImagineAPI) to generate product images from text and image inputs, enhancing product visualization.  
- Implemented Stable Diffusion and DreamBooth, training an in-house model on Sephora images to produce on-brand visuals and improve content creation efficiency.  
- Applied image-to-image generation techniques to create diverse product representations for marketing and brand promotion.

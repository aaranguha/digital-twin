# Work Style

- **Focus & Scheduling:** I prefer tackling my highest-priority and most cognitively demanding tasks in the morning, when I can get the most deep work done.
- **Communication:** Calls for demos, walkthroughs, and showcasing work; Slack/Teams for quick questions and fast iteration.
- **Deep Work:** Mornings are typically reserved for focused, uninterrupted work on high-impact tasks.
- **Feedback:** I value direct, actionable feedback with concrete examples.
- **Decision Making:** I prioritize decisions that maximize impact and learning.
